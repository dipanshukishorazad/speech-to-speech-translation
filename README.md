# speech-to-speech-translation
Built a real-time speech-to-speech translation system using Flask and Python, enabling Hindi voice input, English translation via GoogleTrans, and audio output using gTTS with a responsive web interface.


Developed a real-time speech-to-speech translation web application that converts spoken Hindi into English text and audio output. The system captures voice input using PyAudio, processes speech through Python, translates content using GoogleTrans, and generates English speech via gTTS. Flask handles backend APIs, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript manage the interactive front-end, enabling seamless real-time multilingual communication.
